  title="FAQ"
  left_content="**Do I get a certificate?**  
  For the official Team Topologies trainings, you will get a certificate of completion from Team Topologies Ttd.
  There intentionally is no formal certification available from Team Topologies since they don't believe this adds real value to the industry.

  **What else do I get?**  
  Aside from the best training in the world, the most lovely, funny and knowledgeable facilitators, and of course priceless insights into your organization, you will also get:
    - time back in your life, because work wil go a lot smoother
    - safe money with therapists, because you'll be a lot happier
    - 20% discount to the Team Topologies Academy
    - PDF extracts of the Miro boards
    - PDF of Infographics and cheat sheets"
  
  right_content="
  **Is it worth the investment of time and people?**
  The two aspects which drive the sustainable impact of Team Toplogies are 'shared vocabulary' and 'co-creation'. So the more people who start speaking the same language about the environment in which they work, the better they'll be able to collaborate in finding solutions. Enabling your teams to continuously improve the flow of value, will definitely save you a lot of time and money.

  **But will it work for us?**  
  Every organization is unique. That is why we have a first conversation with you to understand your environment and specific desired outcomes from the training. Based on that, we'll ensure the training is tailored to your organization and, of course, we'll use your specific situation in all the exercises so you can get new insights into where you can improve."
